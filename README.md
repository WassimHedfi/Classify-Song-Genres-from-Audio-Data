# Project Description

This project involves training a classifier to distinguish between Hip-Hop and Rock music genres using Echonest track information. We'll use Python with pandas and seaborn for data exploration, investigating trends. The scikit-learn library will help us build and fine-tune models based on features like danceability, energy, tempo, etc. Algorithms like PCA, logistic regression, and decision trees will be employed for classification.

Through data analysis, feature engineering, and model implementation, this project aims to create an accurate music genre classifier, showcasing proficiency in machine learning techniques and dataset understanding.
